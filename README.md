# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains source code for the most commonly used data structures and algorithms written in Python. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all existing data structures and algorithms, but rather a personal collection of implementations that will be continuously updated as I gain a better understanding of the subject.

## Data Structures

- Dynamic Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
- Priority Queue
- Union Find

## Algorithms
